### Setup Instructions for Running AI Codes

Follow these steps to prepare your environment for running the ai related files:

1. **Install Dependencies**: Ensure you have the required dependencies installed. You can use the following commands to install them:

   ```shell
   pip install notebook transformers torch accelerate openpyxl

2. **Create an Access Token from Hugging Face**: Go to the Hugging Face website (https://huggingface.co/) and create an account if you don't have one. Once you're logged in, you can generate an API token by going to your profile settings. This token is used to access Hugging Face models and datasets.

3. **Install PyTorch**: PyTorch is a deep learning framework that is often used in conjunction with the Transformers library. You can install PyTorch by following the installation instructions on the PyTorch website: [PyTorch Installation](https://pytorch.org/). For example, if you want to install it with CUDA support, you can use the following command:

    ```shell
    pip3 install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118
    ```

    Be sure to choose the appropriate version based on your system and requirements.

4. **Enable Developer Mode for `symlink` (optional)**: If you're specifically instructed to enable developer mode for `symlink`, you should follow the relevant instructions for your operating system. Typically, this involves enabling developer mode through system settings.

5. **Run Jupyter Notebook**: Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where `llama-chat-hf.ipynb` is located. Then, run the following command to start Jupyter Notebook:

    ```shell
    jupyter notebook
    ```

   This will open the Jupyter Notebook interface in your web browser. From there, you can open the `llama-chat-hf.ipynb` notebook and execute the provided code.

Make sure to open the notebook in Jupyter Notebook, load the provided Python code, and set the appropriate paths and API tokens as instructed in the notebook itself.
